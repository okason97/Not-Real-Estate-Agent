Okay, here's a breakdown of the properties from the provided data that seem to best fit your request for a modern, one-person apartment in La Plata with a garage, along with a summary table.  I'm prioritizing "modern" based on features like balconies, updated kitchens (implied by separate kitchens), and overall descriptions suggesting a newer or well-maintained property. 

**Understanding the Challenge:**

The data is limited. "Modern" is subjective and not explicitly stated. I'm inferring modernity based on features and descriptions.

**Top Recommendations (Based on the Data):**

Here's a prioritized list, with explanations:

1.  **ID: 55854095 (Calle 6 y 62)**
    *   **Price:** $600,000 rent + $160,000 expenses = $760,000 total
    *   **Size:** 75 m² (2 bedrooms, 3 rooms)
    *   **Why it's a good fit:**  The description mentions a balcony, a separate kitchen (suggesting a more updated layout), and a garage. The mention of "separate kitchen" often implies a more modern design.  The price is in line with other options.
    *   **Potential Drawback:** It has 2 bedrooms, which might be more space than you need.

2.  **ID: 53124319 (24 1400. Entre 62 y 63)**
    *   **Price:** $545,000 rent + $56,000 expenses = $601,000 total
    *   **Size:** 54 m² (1 bedroom, 3 rooms)
    *   **Why it's a good fit:**  The description highlights a balcony, a separate kitchen, and a garage. The mention of "separate kitchen" often implies a more modern design.  The price is attractive.
    *   **Potential Drawback:** It's a bit smaller than some other options.

3.  **ID: 55854095 (6 y 62)**
    *   **Price:** $600,000 rent + $160,000 expenses = $760,000 total
    *   **Size:** 75 m² (2 bedrooms, 3 rooms)
    *   **Why it's a good fit:**  The description mentions a balcony, a separate kitchen (suggesting a more updated layout), and a garage. The mention of "separate kitchen" often implies a more modern design.  The price is in line with other options.

**Summary Table:**

| ID       | Price (Rent + Expenses) | Size (m²) | Bedrooms | Key Features                               | Notes                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 55854095 | $760,000                 | 75        | 2        | Balcony, Separate Kitchen, Garage          | Larger, 2 bedrooms                       |

| 55854095 | $760,000                 | 75        | 2        | Balcony, Separate Kitchen, Garage          | Larger, 2 bedrooms                       |

**Important Considerations:**

*   **"Modern" is Subjective:**  The data doesn't explicitly state "modern." These are inferences.
*   **View Photos/Visit:**  The descriptions are limited.  It's *essential* to view photos and ideally visit the properties to assess their actual condition and style.
*   **Expenses:**  The "expenses" (often called "expensas") can vary significantly and should be factored into your budget.
*   **Availability:**  The data doesn't indicate availability.  You'll need to contact the listing agents to confirm.



To help me refine the search further, could you tell me:

*   What is your budget?
*   What does "modern" mean to you in terms of style and features? (e.g., open-plan kitchen, updated appliances, specific design aesthetic)
*   What is the minimum size you'd like?
