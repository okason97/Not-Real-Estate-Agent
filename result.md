Okay, here's a breakdown of the properties from the provided data that seem to best fit your request for a modern, one-person apartment in La Plata with a garage, along with a summary table.  I'm prioritizing "modern" based on features like balconies, updated kitchens (though details are limited), and overall descriptions suggesting a newer or well-maintained property.

**Understanding the Challenge:**

The descriptions are somewhat limited. "Modern" is subjective, and I'm interpreting it as newer, well-maintained, and potentially with some desirable features.  The data focuses on the basics.

**Top Recommendations (Based on the Data):**

Here's a prioritized list, with explanations.  I'm also including a summary table at the end.

1.  **ID: 55854095 (Calle 6 y 62)**
    *   **Price:** $600,000 rent + $160,000 expenses = $760,000 total
    *   **Size:** 75 m²
    *   **Bedrooms:** 2 (Could easily be used as a large living area and a bedroom)
    *   **Garage:** Yes
    *   **Why it's a good fit:**  The description mentions a balcony, which suggests a more modern feel.  The size is good for one person, allowing for a comfortable living space. The garage is a key requirement.

**Summary Table:**

| ID       | Rent (ARS) | Expenses (ARS) | Total (ARS) | Size (m²) | Bedrooms | Garage | Notes                                                                 |

**Important Considerations:**

*   **"Modern" is Subjective:** The descriptions are basic.  You're relying on limited information to assess the "modern" feel.  Photos and a viewing are essential.
*   **Expenses:**  The "expenses" (ARS 160,000) are significant.  Clarify what these cover (building maintenance, security, etc.).
*   **Location:** The addresses are provided, but you should research the neighborhoods to ensure they meet your preferences.



To help me refine the search further, could you tell me:

*   What does "modern" mean to you in terms of style and features? (e.g., open-plan kitchen, updated appliances, specific design aesthetic)
*   Are there any specific neighborhoods in La Plata you prefer?
*   What is your budget range?
